# Upgrade Architecture

## Overview

The WaifuClaim contract uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern to allow for contract upgrades. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Storage persistence across upgrades
2. Same address for all contract versions
3. Gas-efficient upgrade mechanism (compared to Transparent Proxy)
4. Lower deployment costs

## Components

### Proxy Contract

The proxy contract is the user-facing contract that:
- Stores all contract state
- Delegates all function calls to the implementation contract
- Remains at the same address throughout upgrades

### Implementation Contract

The implementation contract:
- Provides the logic for the proxy
- Can be upgraded to a new version by the contract owner
- Does not store any state

## Upgrade Process

1. Deploy a new implementation contract
2. Call the `upgradeTo` or `upgradeToAndCall` function on the proxy contract
3. The proxy will start using the new implementation's logic while maintaining all state

## Security Considerations

- The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is protected with the `onlyOwner` modifier
- Use timelock or multisig for the owner to enhance security
- Thoroughly test new implementations before upgrading
- Validate storage compatibility between versions
